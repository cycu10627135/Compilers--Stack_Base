# **Stack-Base Machine**
## Description
Stack-base machine is a kind of CPU design architecture which sometimes be compared with register-based machine. Unlike register-based machine which used 3 address code taking 1 
opcode and 2 corresponding operands e.g. add %eax, 3, stack based machine was designed with opcode with one or zero operand and one long stack which served as registers to take 
temporary value in calculation.
